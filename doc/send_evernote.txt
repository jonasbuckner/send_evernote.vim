*send_evernote.txt*		Plugin for sending simple notes to Evernote.

Author: Sebasti√°n Mancilla Matta <http://www.alumnos.inf.utfsm.cl/~smancill>

Note: Requires an Evernote and Gmail accounts, as well as Gnome Keyring
with python-gnomekeyring configured and running on your local system.

INTRODUCTION                    *send_evernote*

This plugin is for sending the contents of the current vim buffer as a new
note to Evernote.

Once configured, you may call :Evernote on any open file, and its contents
will be sent via Gmail to your Evernote account as a new note. 

The first line of the buffer will be used as title of the note, and all
subsequent lines as the body.

For example, when :Evernote is called on the file: >

 Evernote is Awesome

 I love Evernote and Vim!
 I could never live without this plugin.

It will be sent to your Evernote account with the title "Evernote is Awesome,"
and the body will contain the rest.

The blank line between the title and the body will not be sent as the first
line of note. The note body will start on the first non-blank line in the
buffer.

CONFIGURATION                                   *send_evernote_config*

To configure, you will need an Evernote account, which you can get for free
from http://www.evernote.com/ and a Gmail account (http://www.gmail.com). You
will also running copy of Gnome Keyring with your Gmail credentials installed.

Gnome Keyring will be launched when Gnome is installed, but can be setup to
work with any X11 window manager, desktop environment, or on OSX via MacPorts.
Unfortunately, there is currently no support for MS Windows.

                                                *send_evernote_quick_config*
If you already have accounts and Gnome Keyring set up, you will only need to
set your Gmail username and Evernote email name in your ~/.vimrc:
>
    " Set your GMail username
    let g:evernote_gmail_username = "GMAIL_USER"   
    " Set your Evernote mail local part 
    let g:evernote_email_local_part = "EVERNOTE_EMAIL"
< 

Replace the quoted strings with your actual values.

                                                *send_evernote_get_ev_email*
To find your Evernote email local part, log in to your Evernote account in
a web browser, click your user name in the upper right-hand corner, and
select Settings.

On this page, you will see setting called "Email Notes to" and a link to your
account's custom email address. The local part, required for your .vimrc, is
part before the @m.evernote.com part.

For example, if your address is "evernote_user.bab3@m.evernote.com", you will
need to put "evernote_user.bab3" where it says "EVERNOTE_EMAIL" above.

                                                *send_evernote_setup_keyring*
Setting up Gnome Keyring will not be difficult if you are a Gnome user with
Evolution installed. If you use Evolution as your client with Gmail, it's
probable that you have everything you need and only need to put your variables
into .vimrc (|send_evernote_quick_config|).

If not and you don't want to set up Evolution, you'll need to set up an item
containing the appropriate information in Gnome Keyring manually.

If you aren't a GNOME user, you can run Gnome-keyring from a terminal with 
the command
    gnome-settings-daemon &

You'll then need to add your Gmail password to the default keyring so it can
be stored safely to mail your notes.

This can be done relatively easily with the following Python script: >
 #!/usr/bin/env python
 # Send_Evernote Vim Plugin - Add Gnome_Keyring Item
 # Released under the GPL-compatible Vim License
 # http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html#license
 # The latest version of this script can be found at
 #   https://github.com/smancill/send_evernote.vim

 import gnomekeyring as gke

 # Place your Gmail password in this variable to run the script.
 # For security purposes, remove it directly after running or delete
 # the script.
 gmail_password = "GMAIL_PASSWORD"

 ## OPTIONAL SETTINGS
 gmail_username = "GMAIL_USER"  # Not necessary for the script,
                                # but useful to keep things straight if
                                # you have multiple Gmail accounts.
                                # Don't include the @gmail.com.

 keyring = "default"
 server = "smtp.gmail.com"
 protocol = "smtp"
 ##

 name = protocol + "://"  
 name += ('', gmail_username + "@") [gmail_username != "GMAIL_USER"]
 name += server

 id = gkey.item_create_sync(
        keyring,
        gkey.ITEM_NETWORK_PASSWORD,
        name,
        {'server':server, 'protocol':protocol},
        gmail_password,
        True)
 
 print name + " stored in keyring " + keyring
 
You can verify that it worked by opening a python prompt and entering: >
 >>> import gnomekeyring as gkey

 >>> print gkey.find_items_sync(gkey.ITEM_NETWORK_PASSWORD, {'server':'smtp.gmail.com', 'protocol':'smtp'})[0].secret

to verify that it prints your password from the keyring.

TIPS AND TRICKS                                 *send_evernote_tips*

* TIP #1 - Send a Note into a Specific Notebook

To send a note into a specific notebook, you may add @Notebook to the the title
line. Using the example from the introduction (|send_evernote|): >

 Evernote is Awesome @Send Evernote

 I love Evernote and Vim!
 I could never live without this plugin.

This will create a note with the title "Evernote is Awesome" in the notebook
"Send Evernote." Notice that the space in the middle doesn't matter, as long
as it matches an existing notebook in your Evernote account. It is also
case-insensitive.

If you use a notebook name that does not exist, the notebook won't be created,
but the note will still exist in your default notebook with the @notebook name
in the title.

If given multiple notebooks, the note will be placed in the first listed
notebook with the second @notebook name in its title.

* TIP #2 - Tag Your Notes

To add tags to your notes, add #tagname into the title line of your note.
Using the example from the introduction (|send_evernote|): >

 Evernote is Awesome #Vim Plugins

 I love Evernote and Vim!
 I could never live without this plugin.

This will create a note with the title "Evernote is Awesome" with tagged with
the tag "Vim Plugins." The tags must already exist in your Evernote account,
but spaces are allowed, and all tags are case-insensitive. You may also use
multiple tags in the title, which all be assigned to the note (provided they
already exist).

Like @notebook, if the the tag doesn't exist, the #tag will just become part
of the title of the note.

Tags can also be combined with an @notebook directive for full control over
how the note is sorted in your account.

Full Example: >

 Evernote is Awesome @Send Evernote #Vim Plugins #Scripts

 I love Evernote and Vim!
 I could never live without this plugin.

This will create a note titled "Evernote is Awesome" in the notebook "Send
Evernote" with the tags "Vim Plugins" and "Scripts."
